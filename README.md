# working-with-data
Learning to use Python for data science, using Jupyter Notebooks

# To use this repository

Login into your github account (create one if you don't yet have one)  
Ask your tutor to add you to the repository, using your github username  

### Install the repository folder:  
In your JupyterLab terminal, enter the following:
* git clone 
* cd working-with-data
* git checkout -b <<_your-name_>>

### When you have completed some work (at least three times each learning session)  
* git add . 
* git status

You should now be seeing a list of files that have changed since you cloned, or last pushed

* git commit -m "_describe what work you have completed this session_"
* git push origin <<_your-name_>>

Once this is done, you will have uploaded your updated files and your tutor will be able to see them.
